# Week 7: Coastal Landscapes

![Week 7 Cover image](./assets/images/GY4027_new_banners_Coastal.png)

This week, we will look at landscapes shaped by rivers.

By the end of this week you should be able to:
1. Explain the main processes operating in coastal landscape areas
2. Discuss the balance between erosion and deposition in coastal areas
3. Describe the main coastal landforms

This section will contain lecture slides and the assigned reading for the week.

## Lecture

Lecture Monday 0900-1000, C1-059

Lecture slides: [GY4027 L7 Coastal Landscapes](./assets/lectures/GY4027_L7_Coastal_Landscapes.pdf)

## Labs

LAB GROUP 2B: Friday 1100-1300 in ER2-029

## Reading

### Module textbook

I would like you to read Chapter 13 of Huggett, R. (2017) Fundamentals of Geomorphology, 4th Edition. Routledge, London.

This is the chapter on coastal landscapes.

Available [online](https://archive.org/details/routledgefundamentalsofphysical/) or via the Glucksman Library.

### Academic papers

*Every week I'll also be giving you at least one paper from an academic journal to read. These papers will extend beyond the content of the lecture, giving examples of applying the principles we're discussing. You have to get used now to reading beyond the topic of the lecture - remember, 6 credits equates to 120 hours of work over the semester, of which you get 11 hours of lectures, and 10 hours of labs. That leaves 99 hours of independent work, approximately 8 hours per week. The lectures should be an introduction - even the reading I assign should just be an extended introduction.*

- Blum, M.D. and Roberts, H.H. 2012. The Mississippi Delta Region: Past, Present, and Future. *Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences* **40**, 655–683p. doi: [10.1146/annurev-earth-042711-105248](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-earth-042711-105248K)

This is a nice review paper summarising what is known about the Mississippi Delta.

Zhao, Z., Mitchell, N.C., Quartau, R., Ramalho, R.S., and Rusu, L. 2020. Coastal erosion rates of lava deltas around oceanic islands. *Geomorphology* **370**, 107410. doi: [10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.107410](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.107410)

I like this paper because it showcases some of the methods used in studying coastal geomorphology and erosion, which will be new to you, and also because it's something a bit different (volcanic islands) but the conclusions are more broadly applicable.

### Optional additional reading

In this lecture we looked at the gradual processes of coastal erosion and deposition.

It isn't always gradual.
