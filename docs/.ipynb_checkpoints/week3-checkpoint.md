# Week 3: Transport and Deposition

![Week 3 Cover image](./assets/images/GY4027_new_banners_Transport_Deposition.png)

Material isn't transported for ever, eventually it's deposited.

By the end of this week you should be able to:
1. Explain which transport agents deposit sediments locally, or more widespread
2. Explain the influence of sediment particle size on where sediments are deposited
3. Explain the influence of sediment particle size on where sediments are deposited
4. Describe the concept of accommodation space for sediment deposition

This section will contain lecture slides and the assigned reading for the week.

## Reading

### Module textbook

I would like you to read Chapter Five of Huggett, R. (2017) Fundamentals of Geomorphology, 4th Edition. Routledge, London.

Chapter Five is the chapter on plate tectonics. Tectonics is one of the main driving forces for landscapes, so it's essential to understanding landscape evolution. It's particularly relevant for basin dynamics, which we discuss this week, and in the creation of upland landscapes, which we'll discuss next week.

Available [online](https://archive.org/details/routledgefundamentalsofphysical/) or via the Glucksman Library.

### Academic papers

*Every week I'll also be giving you at least one paper from an academic journal to read. These papers will extend beyond the content of the lecture, giving examples of applying the principles we're discussing. You have to get used now to reading beyond the topic of the lecture - remember, 6 credits equates to 120 hours of work over the semester, of which you get 11 hours of lectures, and 10 hours of labs. That leaves 99 hours of independent work, approximately 8 hours per week. The lectures should be an introduction - even the reading I assign should just be an extended introduction.*

- Scheck-Wenderoth, M. 2020. Sedimentary Basins. *In:* Gupta, H. (eds) *Encyclopedia of Solid Earth Geophysics*. Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series. Springer, Cham. doi: [10.1007/978-3-030-10475-7_216-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-10475-7_216-1)

This is an article from the Encyclopedia of Solid Earth Geophysics, a reference work - so it's (a) a nice general introduction which then (b) gets insanely more complicated than you need towards the end. But the first part is really useful to understand sedimentary basins.

- Dethier, E.N., Renshaw, C.E., and Magilligan, F.J. 2022. Rapid changes to global river suspended sediment flux by humans. *Science* **376**, 1447-1452. doi: [10.1126/science.abn7980](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn7980)

I didn't talk about it in the lecture, but humans are changing geomorphology. We'll cover this more in Week 11, but it's worth considering the human impact on some of what we discussed this week - in this case, sediment transport from rivers into global oceans.

### Optional additional reading

Another paper about how humans are changing processes is

- Hilderman, R., MacDonald, J., Griffin, S., Slaymark, C., Einsle, J., & Monaghan, A. 2024 Heterogeneous lithification across a legacy coastal slag bank: the creation of new sedimentary rock from anthropogenic material. *Sedimentologika* **2**, 1318. doi: [10.57035/journals/sdk.2024.e21.1318](https://doi.org/10.57035/journals/sdk.2024.e21.1318)

Like other "optional" suggested papers, you definitely don't need to try and understand everything in here, but an overview certainly might make you think differently about the topic.
