# GY4027 Labs

![Module Cover image](./assets/images/GY4027_new_banners_Course_Banner.png)

Watching and listening to lectures is a useful part of learning – but it’s one thing seeing photos on a screen, and a different thing completely to hold something in your hand and see it with your own eyes. That’s why this module has a strong laboratory component.

You will have 3 2-hour lab sessions in the Geography Lab ER2-029. In these labs, you’ll examine rocks and sediments from a range of environments, with additional supporting specimens you can examine but don’t have to fully describe, in order to better understand the processes in these environments.

The intention of the labs is not to turn you into a geologist or sedimentologist, or an expert on rock or sediment identification. The intention is that by seeing things with your own eyes, and working things out for yourself, the content you’re learning in the lectures will change from just being words to remember to actually having real meaning.

You will also have a geospatial lab session, where we'll explore some digital analysis of landscapes.

Plus for rivers, we have Ireland's largest river flowing through the campus, and we can learn more from going and looking at it than we could be talking about it in the lab; so we'll spend one session exploring the Shannon.

All of the background, instructions, and questions for each of these 5 labs are linked below.
