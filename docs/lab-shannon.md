# Lab Exercise: River Shannon

For Week 7-8 labs, we will have a visit to the River Shannon, looking at some of the fluvial landscape features and doing a quick exercise taking some measurements to let us calculate the flow of the river. As a follow up, this short exercise uses those measurements to calculate the flow speed and flow volume, and to look at what sizes of sediment would be transported or deposited by the river.

## Flow speed and volume

We will an object in the river at the beach, and time how long it takes to cover a particular distance.

You should record four measurements:

1. The distance travelled by the object - measured by laser range finder, in metres
2. The time it took to travel that distance - timed by stopwatch, in seconds
3. The width of the river channel at that point - measured by laser range finder, in metres
4. The average depth of the river channel at that point - estimated, in metres

From this, we will calculate:

1. The flow speed of the river in metres per second
2. The flow volume of the river in cubic metres per second

### Task 1 - Flow speed

Calculating the flow speed is straightforward. Speed is distance divided by time, so take the distance travelled by the object (in metres), and divide by the time taken to cover the distance (in seconds). 

`Speed = distance travelled (m) / time taken (s)`


### Task 2 - Flow volume

To estimate the flow volume, we need to know the cross-section area of the river. This is the width of the river channel multiplied by the average depth of the channel. If we were doing this precisely, we would want to take multiple depth measurements, so that we could draw the shape of the riverbed, and calculate based on that; but for our purposes, it's enough to take the estimated average.

`Cross section area (m^2^) = measured width (m) x estimated average depth (m)`

The flow volume is the flow speed multiplied by the cross-section area, so simply multiply this result by the flow speed you worked out above.

`Flow volume (m^3^/s) = cross section area (m^2^) x flow speed (m/s)`

### Task 3 - Sediment erosion, transport, and deposition

Different sizes of sediment will be eroded, transported, or deposited at particular flow speeds. This is well understood experimentally, and we can use the diagram below - called the Hjulström curve - to determine what will be happening to grains of different sizes ar particular flow speeds.

Use this diagram to answer the following questions. Note that the diagram uses flow speed in cm/s, so you will have to convert your flow speed by multiplying by 100. Note also that the diagram uses a logarithmic scale for both flow speed and grain size, so the divisions are not equally spaced.

- What is the maximum grain size (in mm) of particles which would be transported by the River Shannon where we measured the flow?

- What is the range of grain sizes (in mm) of particles which could be eroded by the River Shannon where we measured the flow?
