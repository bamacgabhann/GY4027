## Assessment 1: StoryMap

**Due**: Friday 27 March

*50% of module*

> Using ArcGIS StoryMap and your own photos and videos, create a virtual field trip to describe and explain the evolution of a landscape of your choice

You should choose an area which you can go to, and take photos and/or videos of features from that area which show features such as:

- Rocks
- Weathering and erosional features
- Ongoing sediment transport
- Depositional features

You should use your photos / videos to cover:

- The role of Plate Tectonics and geological characteristics in shaping the landscape
- Which processes of weathering and erosion have been significant in shaping the landscape
- Which transport agents and surface processes have been significant in shaping the landscape

Your StoryMap will be assessed on these elements, and on the basis of:

- Your choice of landscape
- Your selection of photos / videos and other content
- Your StoryMap structure and other visual elements
- Your achievement of LO 5 "Display an appreciation of the scales of time and distance in landscape evolution"
- Your achievement of LO 6 "Acknowledge the dynamic nature of all landscapes and environments"

Note: The element of your choice of landscape does not imply that you need to cover a particularly unique landscape; there is no need to travel a very long distance to go somewhere new. You should be able to complete the assignment on an area around the University or at home. The element of choice here primarily depends on the size of the area you choose, and the features you are able to show. If you choose too small an area, it may not have sufficient features to fulfil all of the criteria. If you choose too large an area, you may not be able to cover everything needed to fulfill all of the criteria. The element of choice of landscape is assessing your judgement on this.

If you have sufficient photos / videos of your own from a particular place already (such as an area you have been to on a holiday), you may use those.

**Excluded areas:** The Burren and The Cliffs of Moher are specifically excluded as landscapes for this assignment.

You have previously created an ArcGIS StoryMap in the population Geography module, so it should be familiar - but here is a brief guide to [creating your ArcGIS StoryMap](./storymap.md).

**Grading Rubric:**

| Element | F | D | C | B | A |
| **Selection of landscape (10)** | Poor choice of landscape with little opportunity to explain landscape-shaping processes and landscape evolution *(0-2.5)* | Choice of landscape left insufficient opportunity to explain landscape-shaping processes and landscape evolution *(3-3.5)* | Choice of landscape gave some opportunity to explain some landscape-shaping processes and landscape evolution *(4-5)* | Well chosen landscape giving good opportunity to explain landscape-shaping processes and landscape evolution *(5.5-6.5)* | Excellent choice of landscapes provided strong opportunity to explain landscape-shaping processes and landscape evolution *(7-10)* |
| **Plate Tectonics and geological characteristics (10)** | Insufficient description of the role of plate tectonics and geological characteristics in shaping the landscape *(0-2.5)* | Minimal description of the role of plate tectonics and geological characteristics in shaping the landscape *(3-3.5)* | Some explanation of the role of plate tectonics and geological characteristics in shaping the landscape *(4-5)* | Good explanation of the significance of the role of plate tectonics and geological characteristics in shaping the landscape *(5.5-6.5)* | Excellent analysis of the role of plate tectonics and geological characteristics in shaping the landscape *(7-10)*  |
| **Weathering and erosion (10)** | Insufficient description of weathering and erosion *(0-2.5)* | Minimal description of relevant weathering and erosion *(3-3.5)* | Some explanation of weathering and erosion in the landscape *(4-5)* | Good explanation of how weathering and erosion shaped the landscape *(5.5-6.5)* | Excellent analysis of the role of weathering and erosion in shaping the landscape *(7-10)*  |
| **Transport Agents and Surface processes (30)** | Insufficient description of the transport agents and surface processes which shaped the landscape *(0-8.5)* | Minimal description of the transport agents and surface processes which shaped the landscape *(9-11.5)* | Some explanation of the transport agents and surface processes which shaped the landscape *(12-16)* | Good explanation of the transport agents and surface processes which shaped the landscape *(16.5-20.5)* | Excellent analysis of the transport agents and surface processes which shaped the landscape *(21-30)*  |
| **Your photos / videos and other content (20)** | Own photos / videos and other content insufficient or inadequate to illustrate processes and influences which shaped the landscape *(0-5.5)* | Minimal own photos / videos and other content to illustrate processes and influences which shaped the landscape *(6-7.5)* | Own photos / videos and other content illustrate some processes and influences which shaped the landscape *(8-10.5)* | Good range of own photos / videos and other content used well to illustrate processes and influences which shaped the landscape *(11-13.5)* | Excellent range of own photos / videos and other content used extremely effectively to illustrate processes and influences which shaped the landscape *(14-20)*  |
| **Structure and Visual Elements (5)** | Too short, or unacceptable structure or visual elements *(0-1)* | Structure or visual elements distract from the content; or quite short *(1.5)* | Significant improvements possible in structure or visual elements *(2-2.5)* | Acceptable structure and good visual elements *(3)* | StoryMap is well structured; visual elements excellently support narrative and content *(4-5)*  |
| **Selection and use of Sources (5)** | Sources inappropriate, and/or not useful, and/or not well used *(0-1)* | Few useful academic sources; or sources not well used *(1.5)* | Could have used more academic sources *(2-2.5)* | Good use of at least 5 academic sources *(3)* | Excellent use of 10+ well-chosen academic sources to support content *(4-5)* |
| **Appreciation of the scales of time and distance (5)** | Does not consider time and distance *(0-1)* | Minimal consideration of time and distance *(1.5)* | Some consideration of the scales of time and distance for the landscape *(2-2.5)* | Clear appreciation of the scales of time and distance for the landscape *(3)* | Excellent implicit or explicit appreciation of the scales of time and distance in the evolution of the landscape *(4-5)* |
| **Acknowledge the dynamic nature of all landscapes and environments (5)** | Does not acknowledge dynamic nature of landscapes *(0-1)* | Minimal consideration of dynamic nature of landscapes *(1.5)* | Acknowledges dynamic nature of landscapes *(2-2.5)* | Clear appreciation of the dynamic nature of landscapes *(3)* | Excellent implicit or explicit acknowledgement of the dynamic nature of landscapes *(4-5)* |

## Assessment 2: Written Exam

**Date**: TBC in Weeks 14-15 (Exam Period)

*50% of module*

The written exam will comprise a mixture of short answer and essay questions to  assess your achievement of the learning outcomes across the entire content of the module, including laboratory work.

The short questions may cover the full breadth of the module, while the long questions will give you the opportunity to cover particular topics in more depth.

Questions based on laboratory work will not repeat questions from laboratory exercises, but will ask about topics or material covered in labs.
